        <h3>Game Description</h3>
        <p>A VR horror Escape room Experience, that is what Tarnished is.</p> 

        <p>You're locked in a prison cell in an abandoned part of Russia after the nukes dropped. And have been locked in there for a few months now. But since the bombs dropped and everyone left, you feel watched... Like someone is or something is coming closer each minute.</p> 

        <p>It is your job to get out of there by solving the puzzles before IT eventually finds you and brings your life to a gruesome end.</p> 

        <p>Will you be able to survive?</p>

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>Development on Tarnished started in Febuary.</p>
            <p>The idea was to create a horror vr experience in 2 months time.</p>
            <p>Process started with analysing existing Horror games like: Amnesia, I expect you to die, Chair in a Room, etc.</p>
            <p>I did the Game design. I designed the puzzle, the level and the concept. My friend did the 3D modeling and concept arting</p>
            <p>I worked with the SteamVR SDK</p>
            <p>The Entire project was made in Unity3D and code editor Visual Studio 2019</p>
