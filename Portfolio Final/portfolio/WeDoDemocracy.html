        <p>The assignment, make a concept for a community house for people to get together and discus politics.</p>
        <p> What I did: <br>
          I kept the idea’s realistic, making sure we weren’t to ambiguous for the short time that we had. Because of me we had a fully realized product at the end.<br>
          I concepted for the community center, what kind of activities there would be and how it will relate with politics<br>
          I photoshopped the concept art for the community center.<br>
